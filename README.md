## Overview  
The **Bengaluru House Price Prediction** project is a web-based **machine learning application** that predicts real estate prices in Bengaluru.  
It is powered by a **FastAPI backend** and a **responsive frontend** built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery**.  
### Users can input property details such as **location, area type, total square feet, number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, and balconies** to get an instant estimated property price.



## Live Demo  
You can try out the live version of the app here:

## Tech Stack  

### Frontend  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- jQuery  

### Backend  
- FastAPI  
- Uvicorn
- Pydantic

### Machine Learning  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  

### Deployment  
- Render  



## Model Description  
- **Dataset:** Bengaluru House Prices ([Available here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data))  
- **Algorithms Compared:** Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor  
- **Best Model:** Random Forest Regressor (selected after hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV)  
- **Features Used:**  
  - Location  
  - Area Type (Super Built-up, Plot, Carpet, Built-up)  
  - Total Square Feet Area  
  - Number of Bedrooms (BHK)  
  - Number of Bathrooms  
  - Number of Balconies  

The dataset was cleaned, encoded, standardized, and normalized through a **data preprocessing pipeline**.  
Categorical columns like **location** and **area type** were one-hot encoded.  
The trained model was serialized using **pickle** and integrated into the FastAPI backend through a well-defined **machine learning pipeline** for seamless preprocessing and prediction.
